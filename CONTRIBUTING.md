# Contributing to lab_infra

Thank you for your interest in improving this project!

This repository contains infrastructure-as-code and supporting diagrams and documentation for a secure and reproducible home lab. This is primarily maintained as a personal initiative, discussions and suggestions are welcome.

## How to Contribute

- **Issues**: Feel free to open an issue for bugs, feature suggestions, or architectural feedback.
- **Pull Requests**: PRs are welcome if they:
  - Improve documentation or structure
  - Fix bugs
  - Introduce re-usable logic that fits the labs secure-by-design approach

 If you're unsure if something fits or have questions on the design or architectural decisions, feel free to open an issue or discussion first.

 ## What this is *Not*

 This repo is not intended to:
 - Provide one-size-fits-all configurations
 - Offer tech support for unrelated systems
 - Serve as a general purpose Ansible role library (though safe reuse is encouraged)

Thanks again for supporting the project!
